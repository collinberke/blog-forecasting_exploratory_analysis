# Exploratory analysis of Google Analytics 4 data for forecasting

This repository contains code from a [blog post](https://www.collinberke.com/post/forecasting-series-exploratory-analysis-of-google-analytics-4-data-for-forecasting-models/) overviewing the steps involved when performing an exploratory analysis of time series data. 

It also contains some example code utilizing the `R` [`bigrquery`](https://bigrquery.r-dbi.org/) package to export Google Analytics 4 data for the [Google Merchandise Store](https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/) from [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). 

# Data 

[Googleâ€™s Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) initiative makes this data open and available, and it can be accessed and used by anyone (as long as you have a Google account and have access to [Google's Cloud services](https://cloud.google.com/)). This data represents web site activity, specifically site events from 2020-11-01 to 2021-12-31. This is an obfuscated sample dataset, thus no conclusions about the Google Merchandise store and its usage should be made from this data or analysis. This example code is meant to practice and overview the process of perfoming an exploratory analysis using time series generated from Google Analytics 4 data, and it is not intended to be a valid analysis of website activity. More about the data can be found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10937659#zippy=%2Cin-this-article).
